I've been telling people online in

various ways and in lectures that they

should start fixing up the world by

cleaning up their room and I wanted to

just elaborate on that a little bit

before I get back to the lecture itself

so as it's become this internet weird

internet meme you know and and and it's

a joke and good it's a joke I'm really

happy about the fact that so much of

this has got like the leaven of humor

and it's really important because that's

what stops things from degenerating into

into conflict humor and let's say you

want to sort out your room and beautify

it because the beauty is also important

and let's say that all you have is just

a little room like you're not rich

you're poor and you don't have any power

that's another thing but you've got your

damn room and you've got this space

right in front of you you know that

that's a part of the cosmos that you can

come to grips with and you might think

well what's there in front of you right

in front of you and the answer to that

is it depends on how open your eyes are

that that's the proper answer because

you could say and William Blake said

this for example and Aldous Huxley made

comments that were very similar that in

a transcendent state you can see

infinity in the finite and you might say

well you can say and you can see

infinity and what you have within your

grasp if you look and you could say

maybe that's the case with your room and

so you want to clean up your room well

okay how do you do that exactly well a

room is a room is a place to sleep and

so if you say your room ups properly

then you figure out how to sleep and

when you should sleep and how you should

sleep and then you figure out when you

should wake up and then you figure out

well what clothes you should wear

because they have to be arranged

properly in your dresser and then you

have to have some place to put your

clothes and if you're gonna have some

clothes you have to figure out what

you're gonna wear those clothes to do

right and then that means you have to

figure out what you're going to do and

then your room has to serve that purpose

because otherwise it isn't set up

properly and if it doesn't set up if it

doesn't serve your purposes you will be

unhappy and not happy in the room

because the way that we perceive the

world is as a place to move from point A

to point B in and then if the place that

we're in facilitates that movement then

we're happy to be there and if the place

that we're in serves as an obstacle to

that movement

then we're unhappy to be there and so

what it means to set up your room is

that you have to have somewhere to go

that's worthwhile or you can't set up

your room and then your room has to be

set up to facilitate that and then the

next thing is well maybe you have to

make it beautiful but that's not easy

right that means you have to have some

taste and that doesn't mean you have to

have money it doesn't because you can be

garish with money and you can be

tasteful with nothing all you need is

taste and taste beats money when it

comes to beautifying things you know I

mean note that money is trivial because

it's not but taste is crucial and people

who are very artistically oriented can

make beautiful things out of virtually

nothing and not only that the literature

suggests that if you're going to make

beautiful things putting real

constraints on on what you allow

yourself to do facilitates creativity

instead of interfering with it because

let's say you have to make something out

of nothing right which I suppose would

be a godly act right you have to make

something out of nothing it you have to

be creative in order to do that and so

then to beautify your room means that

you also have to develop your capacity

to be creative and so then you can make

your room shine but then what will

happen is that if your family isn't

together they will interfere with that

you'll interfere with that because you

won't have the discipline to do it

properly but then when you start

building this this this little microcosm

of perfection with what you have at hand

and it'll evoke all the pathologies of

everyone in your household they'll

wonder what the hell you're up to in

there and they won't necessarily be

happy because if you're if they're in a

lowly place let's say and so are you and

you're trying to move out of that then

the higher you move out of that the more

the place they're in looks bad and you

might say well what they should do is

celebrate your victory over chaos and

evil but that isn't what will happen

what will happen instead is that they

will attempt to pull you back down

they'll attempt to and I mean obviously

all families don't do that but but all

families do that to some degree and some

families do almost nothing but that and

so what that means is that if you're

going to organize your room then you're

going to have to confront the devil's in

your house and that's often that's often

a terrifying thing because some of those

Devils have have lineages that go back

many many many

generations and god only knows what you

have to struggle with in order to

overcome that and so and then and so to

sort your cell phone and to fix up your

room is a non trivial matter you know

and you you can do that you'll learn by

doing that and then maybe you'll learn

enough by doing that so that you can fix

up your family a little bit and then

having done that you'll have enough

character so that when you try to

operate in the world at your job or

maybe in the broader social spheres that

you'll be a force for good instead of

harm because you'll have learned some

humility by noting just how difficult it

was to put your damn room together well

and yourself for that matter and so

you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes

open towards the good
